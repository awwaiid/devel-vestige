=head1 NAME

Devel::Vestage - An unofficial New Relic binding for perl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is not an official New Relic product, and is not endorsed by New Relic.

Rather, it is a very basic implementation of a New Relic agent for perl!

=head1 NOTES

Since perl isn't actually supported, this agent lies to the New Relic server and claims to be Ruby. So sad, so sad.
